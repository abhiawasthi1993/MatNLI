Data and codes for paper: Non-linear Inversion and its implementation for mechanical characterization of tissues through elastography

In this study, a parallel MATLAB implementation of an efficient non-linear inversion algorithm based on the finite element method for different isotropic and anisotropic material models, viz., linear elastic and viscoelastic materials in the regime of compressibility and nearly incompressibility. The FEM based non-linear inversion can be utilized for extracting complex physics of the materials. This repository currently contains the data and sample codes for different case studies presented in the paper and their MATLAB implementation.
